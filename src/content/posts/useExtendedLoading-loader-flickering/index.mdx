} from "./LoaderExample"

It's always a good idea to show a loader or indication when calling external APIs over HTTP, since we can't know how long it will take
to complete. Getting this right, may not always be so trivial - I had a case, where fetching data from one particular backend api would sometimes take around a second
or two - slow, right? Other times it would execute within 20ms and that's quite fast, so fast that it would result into loader
flickering for a split second.

To get a better idea of what I'm talking about, I've prepared two mocked samples, which both 'fetch' cat
images for the same time. However the good one uses the `useExtendedLoading` and the
bad one doesn't. Go ahead, click the buttons of the examples and notice the difference.

<div className="d-flex space-evenly">
  <div>
    <h5 className="loaderExample__message">bad</h5>
    <LoaderExample />
  </div>
  <div>
    <h5 className="loaderExample__message">good</h5>
    <LoaderExample shouldExtendloading />
  </div>
</div>

Good, bad? Of course this is subjective. Some may say that it is better to show the result of an api as fast as possible. I don't know about you,
but the 'bad' example really bugs me... So I thought, it would be great if I could make the loader appear for a minimum fixed amount of time.
So that even if the request completes in 20ms, the loader wouldn't just flash, but hang there - in other words I want to 'artificially' extend
the time the loader stays on the screen.

So I came up with a hook, that I solves this issue in a simple way - `useExtendedLoading` that I want to share with you.

## Setup

To show `useExtendedLoading` in action we need to have a component to use it. Let's build a simple functional component and use the
`useState` hook too control, whether we should display a loading indicator or not. Additionally, it should have a button,
so that we can easily repeat the process. The delay here will be hardcoded to just 100ms to guarantee that the loader
would flicker in an obtrusive fashion. 

```tsx
const SimpleLoaderExample = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

  const startLoading = () => {
    setIsLoading(true)
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false)
    }, 100)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {isLoading ? (
        <h3>Loading...</h3>
      ) : (
        <>
          <h3>press the button to load</h3>
          <button onClick={startLoading}>click me</button>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here it is in action:

<SimpleLoaderExample />

So we can avoid this effect by using the following hook:

```tsx
const useExtendedLoading = (isLoading, minTime) => {
  const [isExtendedLoading, setIsExtendedLoading] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isLoading) {
      setIsExtendedLoading(true)

      setTimeout(() => {
        setIsExtendedLoading(false)
      }, minTime)
    }
  }, [isLoading])

  return isLoading || isExtendedLoading
}
```

and we use it like this:

```tsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
const showLoading = useExtendedLoading(isLoading, 400)
```

We will let `showLoading` control whether we should show the loader or not. Most of the time `isExtendedLoading` and `isLoading` will
have the same value, except when it really matters. Everytime `isLoading` becomes `true`, our effect will react and set `isExtendedLoading`
to `true` as well. However, when `isLoading` becomes `false`, `isExtendedLoading` will not react and not become `false`.

As long as either `isExtendedLoading` or `isLoading` is `true` the loader will be shown. If `isLoading` went back to `false`,
the hook will still return `true` until the callback in `setTimeout` triggers. Let's integrate the hook in our our
previous `SimpleLoaderExample` component:

```tsx
const SimpleLoaderExample = () => {
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)
  const showLoading = useExtendedLoading(isLoading, 400)

  const startLoading = () => {
    setIsLoading(true)
    setTimeout(() => {
      setIsLoading(false)
    }, 100)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {showLoading ? (
        <h3>Loading...</h3>
      ) : (
        <>
          <h3>press the button to load</h3>
          <button onClick={startLoading}>click me</button>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## And here it is in action:

<SimpleLoaderExampleWithExtendedLoader />

So now even though `startLoading` 'loads' in 100ms. `showLoading` will still be `true` for 400ms, which will in turn
removes the flickering effect of the loader.

## Conclusion

Prolonging the time that the loader stays on the screen is just one of the ways you can handle the
issue of an api loading 'too fast'. There are other approaches like showing a loader, only if the api
request takes too long. Using custom hooks can definitely help with solving similar issues in an
elegant and reusable way.
