The great thing about a string is, that it can be pretty much anything.
It can hold a name, a sentence, even javascript objects can be represented in a string format - you get the point,
strings have a huge range. That is great and all, however there comes a time when this inclusivity of the
string type is not desired. Wouldn't it be great if you can tell the compiler, that a certain string can
have only 2 or 3 possible values and enforce them during compile time? This is exactly where union string types come in.

## A simple union string type

Let's create a simple `Answer` type and set two possible states for it - `yes` and `no`.

```ts
type Answer = "yes" | "no"

const answer1: Answer = "yes"
const answer2: Answer = "no"
```

Alright, cool. By separating `yes` and `no` with a `|` we've created a union string type. Basically,
a variable of type `Answer` is a string, but is limited to what values it can hold.
To test this, we can try to intentionally put an invalid value:

```ts
const answer3: Answer = "maybe" //compile error
// there is no maybe for a yes or no question ;)
```

Great! We are getting an error when we try to assign an invalid value.
This is exactly the behaviour we want and what we should aim in our code.
The type `Answer` can't be just any string under the sun, it can be only "yes" or "no". This means
that from now on Typescript will guard us from making mistakes.

## Union string types shine best as function parameters

When I read code, I like to see the clear intention of the author i.e. why is this code there and what is it trying to achieve.
One of the ways you can achieve this is by using nice formatting, meaningful function names and union string types instead of
plain strings wherever possible. To show what I mean, lets implement a function, that accepts a string parameter:

```ts
function printTrafficLight(light: string) {
  if (light === "Red") {
    console.log("Stop")
  } else if (light === "Yellow") {
    console.log("Get ready...")
  } else if (light === "Green") {
    console.log("Go go go")
  }
}
```

The thing I don't like about the above example is how my eyes have to go down through the entire body of the
function in order to find out what all the possible states of `light` are. On top of that, I have to make a mental
note that `Red`, `Yellow` and `Green` all start with a capital letter - that's too much work. I'd much rather have
`light` to be a union string type showing me all possible values. Let's rewrite it, shall we:

```ts
type TrafficLight = "Red" | "Yellow" | "Green"
function printTrafficLight(light: TrafficLight) {
  if (light === "Red") {
    console.log("Stop")
  } else if (light === "Yellow") {
    console.log("Get ready...")
  } else if (light === "Green") {
    console.log("Go go go")
  }
}
```

Much better. Now we know what type `light` is ahead of time. No need to note all values start with a capital
letter. On top of that, Typescript will now make sure that we don't pass in a wrong string to `printTrafficLight`.

```ts
printTrafficLight("Green") // Go go go
printTrafficLight("Orange") // compile error - this won't work
```

These are some of the advantages provided by union string types.
It will make your functions easier to reason with and Typescript will help you avoid typos.
So why not give them a try?
