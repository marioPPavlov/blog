Often the messiest part of someone's code tends to be the part where the code branching occurs.
Code branching is essentially the part of the that depends on a certain condition, think of tools
such as `if...else if` statements or `switch` cases. The problem with these tools is that the
more branching cases we introduce the harder to read our code becomes.

```ts
function colorFruitMapper(color) {
  if (color === "yellow") {
    return "banana"
  } else if (color === "red") {
    return "tomato" // yes, tomato is a fruit
  } else if (color === "orange") {
    return "orange"
  } else if (color === "purple") {
    return "grape"
  }
  return "unknown fruit"
}
```

Even in this simple example the code has gotten much too verbose for the task it's trying to accomplish.
There is a way how to write the same code in a much more scalable way by using a plain js object as a lookup table.

```ts
const colorFruitMap = {
  yellow: "banana",
  red: "tomato",
  orange: "orange",
  purple: "grape",
}

function colorFruitMapper(color) {
  return colorFruitMap[color] || "unknown fruit"
}
```

There you go. There are a few advantages to this approach. A lookup table gives us an uncluttered overview of which color corresponds to which fruit.
Should we need to add more colors in the future, it will not be necessary to extend the logic of `colorFruitMapper`.
The more logic, we write, the higher the chance for a bug to slip in unnoticed. Additionally,
this approach si more DRY, becayse the lookup table `colorFruitMap` can be reused.

## Safer Lookup Tables using Typescript

We can make our lookup table even more resilient by using the built in utilty type `Record<Keys,Type>`. Since
it's a generic type we need to provide it with type arguments e.g `Record<string, number>`

```ts
const numberNameMap: Record<string, number> = {
  one: 1,
  two: 2,
  three: 3,
}
```

The first argument - `string` specifies that the keys should be of type `string` and the second specifies the type
of the values - in our case these can only be `number`.
So should someone insert a value of a different type,
we'll get an error which is exactly what we want.

```ts
const numberNameMap: Record<string, number> = {
  zero: null, // error: Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number'
  one: 1,
}
```

## Further type safety with Union String Types

In the previous example, we achieved type safety only for the values, but not for the keys.
The keys of the lookup tables could be any string. When we don't know our
keys ahead of time using the `string` type is alright.
What if we want to make sure that our lookup table has specific keys and doesn't
accept any random strings. We can achieve this by using a Union String Type.
If you are unsure what Union String Types are, you can read my article on them [here](../union-string-type).

```ts
type Color = "yellow" | "red" | "orange" | "purple"

const colorFruitMap: Record<Color, string> = {
  yellow: "banana",
  red: "tomato",
  orange: "orange",
  purple: "grape",
}

function colorFruitMapper(color: Color) {
  return colorFruitMap[color]
}
```

In this way our lookup table becomes exhaustive - we are forced to include all possible values of `Color`.

```ts
type Color = "yellow" | "red" | "orange" | "purple"

const colorFruitMap: Record<Color, string> = {
  yellow: "banana",
}
// the above code has the followin error

//Type '{ yellow: string; }' is missing the following properties
// from type 'Record<Color, string>': red, purple, orange
```

Since Typescript knows which keys we should have, it can protect us from silly mistakes.

```ts
type Color = "yellow" | "red"

const colorFruitMap: Record<Color, string> = {
  red: "tomato"
  yelow: "banana" // error: Type '{ yelow: string; red: string; }'
                  // is not assignable to type 'Record<Color, string>'
}
```

If we add further colors to the `Color` type, Typescript will throw an error and
tell us that we have an unhandled color and 'force' us to add it to `colorFruitMap`.

## Summary

We went from a type unsafe cluttered mess of `if...else if` statements with a lot of repetition statements to a more
structured and reusable approach, where the compiler helps us ensure that our code branching is handled correctly.
